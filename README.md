# attendance-management-using-OpenCV
Face Recognition is one of the best and one of the regularly developing security features used. In this project, the attendance in a class will be monitored by the class camera which will continuously monitor. The studentâ€™s database is fed into the attendance system, and as soon as the camera recognises the face, attendance is marked for that student.Since a class camera is being used, it will be difficult to detect faces if they are shot in different resolutions. This is done using the OpenCV module.Camera is present in the classroom where the students are seated. The camera will constantly monitoring students in the video footage. Using OpenCv library it can be formulated and the matched student faces are then compared to the stored database
